## Windows Installation

First you must install gcc for windows.

I installed this version.
`winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-11.2.0-mingw-w64ucrt-9.0.0-r5`

found at:
[winlibs](https://www.winlibs.com/) (scroll to the bottom under UCRT releases)

I unizpped mine to C:\mingw64. Be sure to add it to your Environment variables mine was `C:\mingw64\bin`

With this added to your path on Windows, you could use windows cmd prompt to run nobuild, or any other mingw shell like gitbash, msys2, or cygwin.

I won't go into detail but you can easily integrate vscode for gcc and by extension nobuild. vscode and nobuild will work very well. You could tweak this setup for your own use. [vscode setup windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)

With gcc working in your shell of choice. You can just follow the [tutorial](./tutorial.md) from here out.

## Finally

Feel free to open a github issue here if you are having difficulty getting nobuild running on windows.

Or if you want to provide a more detailed setup guide, create a PR.
